<h1 align="center"> The Inspiration </h1>

<h2 align="center"> I've always been a big fan of spinning things. Ever since I was a little kid, I've always been fascinated by yo - yo's. How they look when they spin, the science behind how they spin, and the nature itself is mesmerizing. And I wanted to share my interests to all of you. </h2>

<h2 align="center"> And in order to do that, I've made soething similar to a yo - yo. Contrary to yo - yo's, this yo - yo (Sinewave Structures) can change colour and shapes. (Even though some "special" yo - yo's can change colours too). Oh, and you don't have to pay money for "my" yo - yo. You can simply pay with a star ðŸ˜‰
